##### How to use this program
System will ask you to select the form of experiment to do after the query in
command argument is executed.  
Input “1” to test all for 100 times  
Input the corresponding name to test separately, please follow the instructions of the console output. 
The value of k is consistent in the whole program, you cannot change it
unless you run the program again with different k in command line argument  
Please be noted that **knn_grid_disk** is **included** in the program, however, due to it is too time consuming,
I did not include the knn_grid_disk's average execution time in the experiment.  
**Just simply key "disk" when system require
 you to do so to execute the disk function for 100 times. this also applies to Compress**  
Please type the file name by yourself in the program for experiment
